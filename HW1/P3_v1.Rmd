##3.a. Standardize the data and create new dataset with standardized data and name it Ndata.
```{r}
raw_data <- read.csv("raw_data.csv")
Ndata <-scale(raw_data)

```


##3.b. Create the boxplot of all the variables in their original form.
```{r}
boxplot(raw_data)
```


##3.c. Create boxplot of all the variables in their standardized form.
```{r}
boxplot(Ndata)
```

##3.d. Compare the result of part b and part c; interpret your answer.
```{r}
# After standarization, we could find all the data subsets are in a similler distrubution, and they are all Symmetry. 
```

##3.e. Prepare scatter plot of variables A and B. How are the data correlated in these variables? Interpret your answer.
```{r}
plot(raw_data$A~raw_data$B)

# A and B are no correlation, they are distributed ramdommly. 

```
